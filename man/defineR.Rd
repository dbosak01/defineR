\title{Creates Define XML documents}
\description{
The \strong{defineR} package contains functions to
create CDISC compliant define.xml documents suitable for
submission to the FDA. The package also contains related capabilities
to help create and manage metadata needed to create the define.xml.
}
\details{
The \strong{defineR} package uses spreadsheet-based metadata.  The package
can use the metadata to produce the define.xml, define.html, and a check
report.  It also has the capability to create a template to get
you started defining metadata for your project.

The \strong{defineR} package is simple to use.  It contains only two functions:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{write_define}}: Creates a define.xml document and related files.
  \item \code{\link{write_metadata}}: Creates a metadata template.
}
See the [Getting Started](https://defineR.r-sassy.org/articles/defineR.html)
page for an overview of these functions.  Additional
information is available in the function references.
}
